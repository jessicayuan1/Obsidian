to execute a program we need 
1. main memory
2. system bus
3. processor

in linux -- everything is a file. when you type, it writes to a file 

CPU - brain of the computer 
booting - there is 1 almighty address that is hardcoded and in hard drive that has the very first instruction. another 1 almighty address with program that runs the rest of the programs. 

kernel - core part of the OS that speaks to the hardware
linux kernel is the most secure code ever


CPUs have storage locations: registers (has instructions or info)

OS run on the basis of interrupts
Interrupts:
OS stores the program state when interrupt happens onto the stack.

Trap: software generated interrupt. Generate by an error or user program request
