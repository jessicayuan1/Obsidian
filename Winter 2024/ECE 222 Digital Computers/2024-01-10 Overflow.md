Overflow occurs if a result exceeds the representation range 

Sign-extension: replicate the msb

#### Shifting 
- shifting left by n bits = multiply by 2^n
	- same as decimal
- shifting right by n bits = divide by 2^n
- arithmetic shift right vs logical shift right 
	1. with signed ints, you work with arithmetic shift right 
	2. arithmetic shift right replicates the leading bit 

#### Programming in ARM assembly language 
1) Abstract model [1.3]
|Processor  | Memory |

Memory addresses are always a byte number 

ALU arithmetic logic unit 
processor is the bus master 
r/w read write , 0 is write, 1 is read 


Steps (related to diagram)
1. Output PC onto address line of bus (Program Counter); Assert read (r/w = 1)
2. Input data value into IR (Instruction register, do you read or write?)
3. Perform operation specified by the instruction
4. increment the PC program counter (instructions are always 4 bytes, increment by 4)
5. Restore the result into r2 from ALU


```
hello
```

#### Assembly language
* Is human readable and uses mnemonics;  ADD (neumonic/operation)  R2 (destination), R0, R1 (source operands)
* Compiler turns into **Machine language** 
	* Encoded in binary
	* E.G. Add R2, R0, R1
		****Drawing in notes 

2) ARM v7 ISA
	* Instruction set architecture
		* Specifies processor's functionality (compiler related)
	1. Microarchitecture is the hardware design that implements the ISA
	2.
