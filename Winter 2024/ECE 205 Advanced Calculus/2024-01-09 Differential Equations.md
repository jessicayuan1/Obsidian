Differential Equations 

1) Difference between 2nd order DE, Heat Equation (partial differential equation)
2) Heat Equations

3) Differential Equations 
	1. Class 1: Ordinary DE (ODE)
		1) Damped, mass-spring systems (physics)
			- With external force function
		2) 
	
	1. Class 2: Partial DE (PDE)
		a. Involve function of more than 1 variable and partial derivatives

#### Basic Circuits and Heat Equations and Spring mass systems
can use partial differential equations
