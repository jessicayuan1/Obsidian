A 1st order ODE is in normal form if it can be written as y' = f(x,y)

A particular solution to the ODE is just a choice of a differentiable function theta(x)

An initial value problem is an ODE
together with an initial condition

#### Separable ODEs:
If f(x,y) can be written as f(x,y) = g(x)h(y), we call the ODE y'=f(x,y) separable 

Solving separable equations:
dy/dx = g(x)h(y)
Rearrange: divide by h, multiply by dx

1/h(y) dy = g(x)dx
Integrate both sides
Get **algebraic** equation H(y) = G(x) + C

Last step: Solve for y(x)
