- Which formula was the thing I was talking about 
	- using Jacobi's vs augmented matrix
		- Why are they so similar??
		- if you augment A|b, that result will give you the exact u
		- If you use iteration with Jacobi, give you inexact but you don't have to solve system of equations (augmented is a lot of rows and that's really inefficient)


bracketing is just binary search 
Guess the midpoint mid 2 a b x   . If f x mid   0 , then a root must still be on the interval  x b mid ,  , while if f x mid   0 , then the root must be on a x, mid  . We repeat this algorithm on this new smaller interval.


Differentiation tneds to amplify noise while integration attenuates it 

3. Given the four points (2517.32, 13.92), (2527.54, 18.23), (2537.76, 19.61) and (2547.98, 20.04), approximate the value at x = 2537.09 by first finding h and delta, then finding the appropriate interpolating polynomial, and then evaluate this polynomial at .

If you only have prior information, do you only want to appronixmatre values in the past, or extrapolate values into the future? 
	The error grows quickly outside of the interval
		Using interpolating polynomials to estimate the value at the next time resutls in an error at leaST 8 TIMES large than the estimate of any value of the 2nd last value recorded
		Stick with using last 2 3 4 points to estimate vlaues in the most recent time interval

- You can set y1-y2 because any combination of your general solution y =c1y1 + c2y2 solves the IVP!!
