02-21 Wednesday
	finish reviewing 204 ✅
	finish reviewing 250 ✅
	finish reviewing 222 stack pointers and interrupt handlers✅

02-21 Thursday
- Goal -- Reinforce above learning -- **implement heap, binary search tree**
- Do **1 secant method question and derivative approximation question**
- Do 1 222 practice exam✅
	- Interrupt handlers, polling cycle calculation ✅
	- 
	- 
- **Do 240 SCHMITT TRIGGER PROBLEMS**
	- Updated 240 Midterm Review pdf
	- RLC Circuits
	  1 RLC 
	  Op Amp formula question
	  Schmitt trigger
	  thevenin equiv
	  Difference amplidier

Questions:
1. How do I use derivatives and integration approximation techniques?
2. How do I calculate 222 clock cycle
	1. cycle per second / cycle per poll / sample per second 
3. tracing the stack during subroutines
	1. I'm not really sure where to start and begin, why do we start with L1? That's because LR has stored the label L1 as the next line of code to execute when we compiled. 
4. What is a heap and priority queue?
	1. Heap is an array representation of binary tree reading from left to right. Has max and min heaps. Priority queue can be implemented using heap structure, and has functions like polling, peek,
5. How do subroutines work in ARM?
	Subroutines store a link register in R15 (address of the next line of code to execute immediately after subroutine completes) and uses a program counter R15 to hold the address of the instruction from memory.
		BL - two things: keeps next line R14, sets PC to address of foo subroutine


Secant method 
xn+1 = xn -    / approxmiated slope

Reflection: omg things are starting to make sense, I get a feelign of 222 way better. 250 should be alright as well, you did the questions pretty nicely for multiple hcoice. Just work on implementing the actual code and you'll be good because you have your baiscs down, you just need to work on puttig it to action. 

Derek: "I posted some more questions today. So, if you’ve got the Module 1 fundamentals in good shape, and can do all the Module 2 questions in the ECE 240 Practice Problems pdf and in the Midterm Review pdf (the new ones I made today - I’ll post solutions), then you’re really all set. Review the slides from class, too, make sure you’ve got the high-level understanding locked in, make sure you can use nodal, and you’re all good."
